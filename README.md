# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to create some enhancements to the PlanMyTrip app. Specifically, it was to add the weather description to the weather data, then create input statues to filter the data for client's weather preferences, which would be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, a travel iteniary would be created with four destinations and shown on a marker layer of Google Maps.
